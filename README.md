## Project Description

This project is a hands-on practice repository for learning and mastering Angular Directives, based on the "Angular - The Complete Guide" course by Academind on Udemy. It demonstrates custom structural and attribute directives, best practices, and real-world usage scenarios to enhance Angular applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular 18** (with Angular CLI)
- **TypeScript**
- **HTML5 & CSS3**

## Course Reference

This repository follows exercises and examples from the Academind course:
- [Angular - The Complete Guide (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
